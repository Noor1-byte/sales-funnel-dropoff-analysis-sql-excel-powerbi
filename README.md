# 🚀 Sales Funnel Drop-Off Analysis | SQL + Excel + Power BI

🔍 This project analyzes a real-world **user sales funnel** to identify where users drop off during their journey — from Homepage to Final Purchase. It was built end-to-end using SQL, Excel, and Power BI.

## 🔧 Tools Used
- **SQL (SSMS)** – Data cleaning, joins, behavioral funnel logic
- **Excel** – Validation of funnel stages, pivot analysis, pre-visual checks
- **Power BI** – Dashboard development, DAX, KPIs, interactive visuals

## 📊 Key Funnel Stages Analyzed:
1. Homepage Visit  
2. Search  
3. Payment  
4. Confirmation

## 💡 What I Built:
- ✅ SQL queries using `LEFT JOIN`, `CTEs`, and filters to track users across funnel stages  
- ✅ Excel sheet to validate drop counts before dashboarding  
- ✅ DAX measures in Power BI to calculate:
    - Home → Search Drop %
    - Search → Payment Drop %
    - Payment → Confirmation Drop %
- ✅ Fully interactive dashboard with slicers, cards & bar visuals

## 📈 Insights Found:
- 90,410 users visited the homepage
